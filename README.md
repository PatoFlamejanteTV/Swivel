Converts Adobe Flash SWF files to video.

## Binaries

The latest stable release of Swivel can be found at <https://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/creator-resources/flash-resources/swivel?path=/wiki/creator-resources/flash-resources/swivel>.

## Building from source

Swivel is built using the [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org) programming language.

[`hmm install`](https://github.com/andywhite37/hmm#installing-hmm) to install the haxelibs

Run `haxe Swivel.hxml` to build, then run `PackageApp.bat` to package the app.

The current source will have regressions from the binary release on Newgrounds;
I'm trying to get everything working again!
